#+CAPTION: P(246, 3, 3, 3, 3): The space of all triangulations of the sphere with 2*246 triangles
#+NAME:   fig:p246
[[./246.png]]


  The program does computations of the space P(n; 3, 3, 3, 3), i.e, given 2*n
  equilateral triangles, the space of all different Tetrahedras that can be
  formed by gluing them together.
** Requirements
  To compile the code in a Unix/Linux environment, you can use make. The program
  needs [[https://www.boost.org/][Boost C++ libraries]] and [[https://www.mpfr.org/][GNU MPFR]].
** Files
   1. matrix.hpp: contains the data structure to represent the 2x2 matrix.
   2. algorithms.hpp: contains the implementation of `fundTransform`, an
      algorithm that takes a 2x2 integer matrix and transforms it using the
      operators S and T, in such a way that the resulting matrix's represenation
      in Complex plane will lie on the standard fundamental domain of PSL_2(Z).

      genSpace: this is the main algorithm discussed in the thesis. The
      algorithm runs the fundTransform algorithm on a finite set of matrices,
      which can be proven to generate an exhaustive list of matrices
      corresponding to P(n; 3, 3, 3, 3).

      genPoints: this runs the fundTransform algorithm on 'random' matrices of
      determinant $2n$. Given a large enough sample size, in practice, the
      algorithm seems to exhaust the space P(n; 3, 3, 3, 3).
** R Scripts for visualization
   Some R scripts are included to help visualize the output of the C++ program.
   These scripts can be found under the folder: r-scr.

   The file poincare.R provides a small R library that can help plot the
   Poincare Upper half space.
